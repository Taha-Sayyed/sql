# 📊 SQL Learning Journey
Welcome to my SQL learning repository!
Fascinated by data and databases, I began my journey into the world of SQL to better understand and interact with structured data. This repository documents my hands-on learning experience and practice with SQL across various platforms.

Most of my learning is inspired by **[Data With Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_0Veya2XAY&list=PLNcg_FV9n7qZY_2eAtUzEUulNjTJREhQe&index=1)** , whose clear and practical teaching style has been instrumental in helping me grasp SQL concepts effectively.

Here, you’ll find:

📘 Practice queries

🧠 Concept-based exercises

🛠️ Platform-based challenges (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)

📌 Notes and learnings from my journey

Whether you're a beginner exploring SQL or someone brushing up your skills, feel free to explore and learn along with me!
